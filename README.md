# Network Traffic Analyzer (Python)

This project analyzes network traffic data using Python and provides basic risk classification for cybersecurity monitoring.

## Skills Applied
- Python programming
- Data analysis with pandas
- Visualization with matplotlib
- Basic network and cybersecurity concepts

## Project Description
The program simulates network traffic from multiple devices. It calculates:
- Packets sent
- Packets received
- Difference between sent and received packets
- Risk classification based on traffic anomalies

This helps in detecting potentially suspicious devices and understanding network behavior.

## How It Works
1. Data is stored in a pandas DataFrame
2. Differences between sent and received packets are calculated
3. Devices are classified as NORMAL, MEDIUM RISK, or HIGH RISK
4. Results are visualized with bar charts

## Next Steps
- Expand with real network traffic logs
- Add more advanced anomaly detection algorithms
- Integrate with cybersecurity monitoring tools
